**Repeto** is a bioinformatics library designed to assist researchers in studying inverted repeats (IRs) in DNA/RNA
sequences. Its main features include:

- *Flexible IR prediction*.
- *Optimization of IR matching*. For RNA, the optimized set of IRs can be converted into a correct secondary
  structure.
- *High-performance & ease of use*. Library core is implemented in Rust and provides typed and documented
  Python bindings.
